        <p>As anyone who has had the good fortune of experiencing it knows, there’s nothing quite like spotting a wild
            animal in its natural habitat. While seeing wildlife is never guaranteed, knowing a little more will
            increase the likelihood and make those chance encounters even sweeter.</p>

            <h2 id="wildlifeFeed">Don't feed animals</h2>
            <p id="feedText">Feeding wildlife can habituate them to human presence and hurt their chances of survival.</p>

        <section>
            <h2 id="wildlifeCampsite">Make your campsite or picnic wildlife safe</h2>
            <p id="campsiteText">All human food and pet food must be stored in a hard-sided food locker or enclosed vehicle when not in
                use. Additionally, make sure to clean up your site when you leave, and dispose of garbage properly. Even
                though black bear sightings are rare, racoons and other animals with a great sense of smell can still
                become negatively impacted when trash and food is improperly stored.

        <section>
            <h2 id="wildlifeSlow">Slow down for wildlife</h2>
            <p id="slowText"> The park speed limits exist to keep visitors and wildlife safe. Use extra caution when driving at dawn,
                dusk or nighttime, as these tend to be the hours when wildlife is most active.
